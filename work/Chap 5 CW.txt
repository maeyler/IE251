Determine the value of c that makes the function f(x,y) = c(x+y) a joint probability mass function over the nine points with x = 1, 2, 3 and y = 1, 2, 3. 

(a) Determine the following: P(X=1,Y<3)  P(Y=2)

(b) Determine the marginal probability distribution of the random variable X.

(c) Determine the conditional probability distribution of X given that Y=2.
