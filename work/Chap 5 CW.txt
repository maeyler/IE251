Each front tire on a vehicle is supposed to be filled to a pressure of 26 psi. Suppose the actual air pressure in each tire is a random variable (X for the right tire and Y for the left tire) with joint pdf:

f(x,y) = K(x+y)    for 20<x<30 and 20<y<30

a) What is the value of K?

b) What is the probability that both tires are underfilled?

c) Determine the distribution of the air pressure in the right tire

d) Are X and Y independent?

Determine the value of c that makes the function f(x,y) = c(x+y) a joint probability mass function over the nine points with x = 1, 2, 3 and y = 1, 2, 3. 

(a) Determine the following: P(X=1,Y<3)  P(Y=2)

(b) Determine the marginal probability distribution of the random variable X.

(c) Determine the conditional probability distribution of X given that Y=2.
