3-102. When a computer disk manufacturer tests a disk, it writes to the disk and then tests it using a certifier. The certifier counts the number of missing pulses or errors. The number of errors on a test area on a disk has a Poisson distribution with λ = 0.2.
(a) What is the expected number of errors per test area?
(b) What percentage of test areas have two or fewer errors?

3-118. Determine the constant c so that the following function is a probability mass function:  f(k) = ck for k = 1, 2, 3, 4

3-119. A manufacturer of a consumer electronics product expects 2% of units to fail during the warranty period. A sample of 500 independent units is tracked for warranty performance.
(a) What is the probability that none fails during the warranty period?
(b) What is the expected number of failures during the warranty period?
(c) What is the probability that more than two units fail during the warranty period?

The phone lines to an airline reservation system are occupied 40% of the time. Assume that the events that the lines are occupied on successive calls are independent. Assume that 8 calls are placed to the airline.

(a) What is the probability that for exactly two calls the lines are occupied?

(b) What is the probability that for at least one call the lines are not occupied?

(c) What is the expected number of calls in which the lines are all occupied?
