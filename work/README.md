### Term Project
#### Calculation of the theoretical values in your project

**Part 1:** U is discrete uniform (0, 9)

E(U) = E(X) = 4.5    

V(U) = (10²-1)/12 = 8.25

V(X) = 0.825


**Part 2:** U is exponential (1/4.5)

E(U) = E(X) = 4.5    

V(U) = 4.5² = 20.25

V(X) = 2.025

P(X < 2) = P(Z < -1.76) =0.04


#### Part 3 -- due on Dec 27

Formulate and explain the Central Limit Theorem using the distributions in the first and second part of the project 

* With n = 4, 25, and 50, make three tables of 100xn random digits (discrete uniform with mean 4.5)

* Let X denote the average of n numbers in each row.

* Draw three histograms for X (see Fig 7-3 in the book)

* Define two events (such as X<2) and compare their probabilities using normal approximation with the observations in each table

Repeat the steps above with for the exponential distribution with mean 4.5 (using two digits after decimal point)
